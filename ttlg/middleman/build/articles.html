              <a href='http://livewellusa.com'>Live Well USA</a>,
              a website dedicated to promoting healthy and wellness via informative articles with kicky titles such as “Get Off the Iceberg” and “Start Moving, or Start Dying.” Joe and Yokho, originally from Seattle, took a well-deserved holiday to tour various parts of Asia recently, and an extended layover forced them to cool their heels in Seoul. Our mission: craft a tightly scheduled itinerary for the couple; they only have six hours to explore our city for the first time. Putting a wrench into the whole operation? Yokho’s MSG allergy, which found us crossing many local dining options off the list. But this is Seoul Safari—we’re always up for a challenge!

            <h4>Before you arrive</h4>
            <p>
              Although weekend traffic can be unforgiving at times, we recommend cabbing around town to maximize the most of your time in Seoul (this CNNGo
              <a href='http://www.cnngo.com/seoul/life/seoul-taxi-guide-783378'>taxi guide</a>
              is helpful). Korean cabs are relatively affordable (just avoid the black “premium” cabs). The only problem with taxis is that most drivers don’t speak English. Fortunately, there’s an app for that. Before you arrive, download the
              <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/seoul-taxi-guide/id454324478?mt=8'>Seoul Taxi Guide</a>
              on your iOS device. Featuring over 3,000 relevant and popular venues and destinations, this app not only lists and maps out information, it features a handy “taxi card” that tells the driver where you need to go in Korean. If that doesn’t work, provide the street address of your destination. All taxis in Seoul have GPS navigation.

            <h4>Exchange currency at ICN once you land</h4>
            <p>You won’t get the best rates at the airport, but you’ll want to have some Korean won in your pocket for petty purchases, including those from mom-and-pop vendors who prefer cash. Some vendors have a “cash rate,” which may be about 1,000 won cheaper than paying by card (essentially charging the transaction surcharge to the customer).</p>
            <p>Much of what Seoul has to offer is free or cheap, especially when it comes to sightseeing and local food (e.g., admission to Seoul’s palaces is only 3,000 won). The most expensive item on your safari will likely be your organic meal, followed by café drinks (don’t be surprised to pay up to 5,000 won for a cup of Americano). A standard, simple Korean meal costs 5,000 to 10,000 per person. However, ethnic dishes such as pasta dinners might run 12,000 to 20,000, depending on the neighborhood.</p>
            <p>As for taxi rates, it normally doesn’t take more than 20,000 won to go from one side of Seoul to another. None of the cab rides in your safari should exceed 10,000 won (unless you encounter extreme traffic). Basic fare starts at 2,400 won and credit cards are accepted, although the driver may mutter insults under his breath if you pull out the card for a short ride.</p>
            <p>So with all that said, 150,000 won should be able to cover the basic expenses for a short tour of Seoul.</p>

            <h4>Leave your baggage behind</h4>
            <p>You’ll be coming to Korea with a bagful of souvenirs so you’ll want to utilize the storage lockers at ICN to enjoy your day in Seoul, baggage-free. Transit passengers are welcome to store their bags at no cost for up to 24 hours at the storage lockers on the 3rd floor, near Gate 25 (East) and Gate 29 (West).</p>

            <h4>Zip into Seoul Station on the Airport Express</h4>
            <p>
              There’s always weekend traffic in Seoul, and this is especially true in the month of November as Seoulites head to the countryside to enjoy the last stretch of fall foliage. The best way to maximize your time in the city is by taking the newly-constructed Airport Railroad (AREX), a speedy rail service on the B1 floor of the airport’s Transportation Center. The Express train that runs every 30 minutes will bring you to the heart of Seoul (Seoul Station) in 43 minutes for 13,300 won (alternately, regular Commuter trains take only 10 more minutes but cost a mere 3,700 won).

            <h4>Emerging winter street food</h4>
            <p>
              Once you’re in Seoul, you may find it’s not easy to find many local breakfast options at this hour—especially healthy ones. Your best bet for an additive-free breakfast is either at a western-style brunch restaurant or at a cafe-bakery such as Paris Baguette. But in between landmarks and pit stops, keep your eyes peeled for some of our favorite seasonal treats. One of the best things about winter in Seoul is the comfort food like
              <em>gun-goguma</em>
              (wood-fired sweet potatoes),
              <em>ho-ddeok</em>
              (sweet flatcakes), egg bread, and the red bean-filled rice bread,
              <em>ho-bbang</em>.

              Most first-time visitors to Seoul get the royal treatment at

              the largest of the Five Grand Palaces of the Joseon Dynasty, but we also love the smaller and perhaps more alluring
              <a href='http://eng.cdg.go.kr/main/main.htm'>Changdeokgung</a>.
              If you decide on Changdeok Palace, don’t miss the lush landscape and lotus pond located behind the palace at the
              <em>Biwon</em>,
              or Secret Garden. It’s criss-crossed with long walking paths perfect for both meandering and brisk walks.

            <h4>Samcheong-dong fusion chic</h4>
            <p>Six hours doesn’t leave you much time to explore the area south of the river known as Gangnam. Instead of a whirlwind trip to hit up downtown hotspots like Garosu-gil or Cheongdam-dong, we recommend sticking to the uptown equivalent, Samcheong-dong, for shopping and light fare. The main Samcheong-dong road is an eclectic mix of old hanok architecture, modern architecture, galleries and street kiosks peddling waffles and espresso drinks. Unlike its southern counterparts, Samcheong-dong sits on a limited development zone that bars the construction of buildings exceeding 20 meters in height. Many assume that’s because the area is adjacent to the presidential “Blue House,” but the restriction was actually implemented in the early 1970s to keep high-rise buildings from obstructing the view of the majestic Bugaksan (북악산, or Bugak Mountain), which borders much of northern Seoul.</p>

            </h4>
            <p>Depending on how much you’ve walked or eaten so far in your day, this may be a good time for tea. Seoul’s independent cafe culture is booming, and the nostalgic streets of Samcheong-dong are no exception. Perhaps what makes this café special is that it specializes in organic traditional Korean teas and cookies. Don’t ask for coffee if you need a pick-me-up—it’s not even on the menu.</p>

            <h4>Insa-dong for last-minute souvenir shopping</h4>
            <p>Most people say a trip to Seoul isn’t complete without a quick stroll down Insa-dong, a long traditional boulevard filled with Korean tea houses, restaurants, galleries and souvenir shops. While that might sound appealing, keep in mind the area is quite touristy and busy—especially on weekends. We’ve made Insa-dong the last priority on your list. After all, by now, you will already have traversed the streets of Samcheong-dong, a traditional experience that’s preferred by locals.</p>
            <span class='label'>Tip</span>
            <p>
              <em>Instead of walking in through the main entrance where the tourist information booth is located, enter through another opening immediately off Anguk Station, exit 6 (it’s so narrow, it looks more like a gap than a road). Take this labyrinth filled with tiny restaurants and tea shops into the heart of Insa-dong.</em>

              <em>Munteok Eop-neun Bapjip</em>
              (문턱없는 밥집), which loosely translates to “the house without a doorstep.” It’s located near the vibrant Hongdae area and is a big proponent of the “clean bowl” movement, which encourages diners to finish every single grain of rice. The DIY vegetarian rice wraps that come with a bowl of fermented mushroom soy paste may seem a bit spicy, but with steaming white rice and a bottomless side of leafy greens, it may be just the meal you’re looking for after a string of processed on-flight meals. After the meal, duck into the adjacent sister store,
              <em>Gibun Joeun Gagae</em>
              (기분 좋은 가개, or literally, “feel-good store”) where you can find used clothes and other bric-a-brac at feel-good prices.

            <p>Jeong In-keom is not a household name. He’s an actor, and a great one at that, but he’s not in your living room selling orange juice or kimchi refrigerators. Instead, you’ll find him in Daehakro, Seoul’s Broadway, Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway all rolled into one. This theatre district in Jongro-gu is host to thousands of students and actors and home to about a hundred small to mid-sized (but mainly small) theatres, including Seondol Theatre where Jeong has been a long-time collaborator. Over the past 20 years, he has starred in 50-some productions and has made Daehakro his home, work and playground, but when we met him one weekend at the coffee truck on the lawn of Seondol, he admitted that he’s finally ready to branch out.</p>

            <p>“I had a film audition today,” he said, gesturing to a folded A4 sheet on the table. The flimsy paper turned out to be his actor resume. “I discovered that kids these days laminate their resumes and headshots. Can you believe it? Laminate!”</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>As Jeong prepares for the next phase of his career, he’s following a strict diet and fitness regimen while weaning himself off compulsive shopping sprees at his favorite flea market (although he made an exception to take us there). He introduced us to his havens—both in and out of doors—which were all located in two of the oldest neighborhoods in Seoul.</p>
            <p>With the adjoined districts in mind, we’ve mapped out the stage actor’s Seoul chronologically—from the early bird market specials in Jongro-gu to the third round of drinks at a Daehakro dive bar.</p>

                “This is not your typical gentrified flea market. Many poor people come here. And migrant workers. And Gangnam girls looking for luxury goods in a haystack. Not a lot, but a few. The cutest of them all are young middle and high school students. They want to look put together, but they don’t have the money. How cute is that? Imagine, at that age, how much they want to look good. And of course, old men with nothing to do frequent the market too. Everything I’m wearing right now is from this place. I think I’ve used about a third of my earnings last year at this market. And of course, I end up giving most of them away.”

                “I like taking the back roads of Hyehwa-dong to the top of the fortress. From there, you can see the presidential blue house. En route to the fortress, you’ll see a very affluent neighborhood to your right. That’s Sungbuk-dong (성북동). Times have changed, but back in the day, we used to call it the Beverly Hills of Seoul. On a nice day, you can see all the way to Gangnam from here. Sometimes, when I come out to Daehakro, I’ll have lunch with friends around 2 pm and I might head to Malbawi (말바위) at the end of the fortress wall and I’ll take in the vista from there. There are a lot of actors who suffer—it’s a hard profession—so you find yourself climbing a lot. For mental and physical health. The trek along the fortress is not exactly climbing—a two-hour walk at most. Many Daehakro actors are part of climbing teams and they sometimes travel in groups of 30 or 40 on Mondays. But I prefer to go alone.”

Instead of accepting a lot of money to lease out the space, they shoulder the cost and host many quality productions. It’s very small, but the equipment—lighting, speakers, everything—is very nice. The envy of all directors. For the past two consecutive years, our company has swept taken the Seoul Theatre Festival, including this year’s Grand Prize with 복사꽃지면 송화날리고

When asked about this watering hole, Jeong hesitated. “Bunjangsil,” he sighed. “It’s definitely a comforting bar. I try not to go too often but I always somehow find myself there after the third or fourth round. I don’t like going there and meeting people I know all the time. It’s nice to see acquaintances, of course, but sometimes it’s tiring. A lot of actors who are going through hard times frequent this bar. Those people want to see people they know. But me, I’m different. The more I struggle, the more I want to be alone.”

            <h2>A just-right destination to suit your basic café needs.</h2>
            <p>There’s nothing particularly extraordinary about Hongdae’s 405 Kitchen. It doesn’t break new stylistic ground, nor does it boast a menu of dishes to wow your palate. There isn’t a stage to showcase the trendiest new bands or gimmicks like underwater finger painting or skin-nibbling fish footbaths. Sure, the décor is endearing with its antique trinkets sitting atop mismatched shelving and chalkboard walls adorned with personal messages, but all this is hardly groundbreaking by Korean café standards.</p>
            <p>Instead, 405 Kitchen aims to fulfill all of your potential café needs, whether it be for work, meeting friends, or filling those in-between times with restful pause.</p>

              The standard array of coffee drinks? Check. Beer and wine? Check. Café fare to appease your appetite? Check. Add in the free Wi-Fi and variety of seating options, and you’ve got a go-to destination in my book. Make a beeline for 405 Kitchen if, for example, you’ve got an hour before dinner and two of your friends need caffeine, another needs a beer, and you, yourself, are starving because one roll of

              There is one rather unique interior feature that sets 405 Kitchen apart: A semi-lofted area in the back offers floor seating on large, comfy cushions around low, round tables. Kick off your shoes before stepping in, and enjoy the abundant view of the foliage in their veranda., which is especially nice during the day. And should you be out with your honey, floor seating is much more convenient for (discreet) side-by-side snuggling. (But please, lest I regret my words, spare us your more outrageous PDA.)

              Despite my offhand dismissal of “trendy-café-standard,” I personally like the light bulbs that line the chalkboards and the ladles hanging on the wall. The blend of quirky with the well-worn makes for a comfortable
