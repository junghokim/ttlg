                <p>Jeong In-keom is not a household name. He’s an actor, and a great one at that, but he’s not in your living room selling orange juice or kimchi refrigerators. Instead, you’ll find him in Daehakro, Seoul’s Broadway, Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway all rolled into one. This theatre district in Jongro-gu is host to thousands of students and actors and home to about a hundred small to mid-sized (but mainly small) theatres, including Seondol Theatre where Jeong has been a long-time collaborator. Over the past 20 years, he has starred in 50-some productions and has made Daehakro his home, work and playground, but when we met him one weekend at the coffee truck on the lawn of Seondol, he admitted that he’s finally ready to branch out.</p>

                <p>“I had a film audition today,” he said, gesturing to a folded A4 sheet on the table. The flimsy paper turned out to be his actor resume. “I discovered that kids these days laminate their resumes and headshots. Can you believe it? Laminate!”</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>As Jeong prepares for the next phase of his career, he’s following a strict diet and fitness regimen while weaning himself off compulsive shopping sprees at his favorite flea market (although he made an exception to take us there). He introduced us to his havens—both in and out of doors—which were all located in two of the oldest neighborhoods in Seoul.</p>
                <p>With the adjoined districts in mind, we’ve mapped out the stage actor’s Seoul chronologically—from the early bird market specials in Jongro-gu to the third round of drinks at a Daehakro dive bar.</p>

                    “This is not your typical gentrified flea market. Many poor people come here. And migrant workers. And Gangnam girls looking for luxury goods in a haystack. Not a lot, but a few. The cutest of them all are young middle and high school students. They want to look put together, but they don’t have the money. How cute is that? Imagine, at that age, how much they want to look good. And of course, old men with nothing to do frequent the market too. Everything I’m wearing right now is from this place. I think I’ve used about a third of my earnings last year at this market. And of course, I end up giving most of them away.”

                    is known for being spicy, but what this modest restaurant serves up in large silver bowls is beyond belief. “I come here sometimes after shopping but it’s not that economical at 9,000 won a bowl.”

En route to the fortress, you’ll see a very affluent neighborhood to your right. That’s Sungbuk-dong (성북동). Times have changed, but back in the day, we used to call it the Beverly Hills of Seoul. On a nice day, you can see all the way to Gangnam from here. Sometimes, when I come out to Daehakro, I’ll have lunch with friends around 2 pm and I might head to Malbawi (말바위) at the end of the fortress wall and I’ll take in the vista from there. There are a lot of actors who suffer—it’s a hard profession—so you find yourself climbing a lot. For mental and physical health. The trek along the fortress is not exactly climbing—a two-hour walk at most. Many Daehakro actors are part of climbing teams and they sometimes travel in groups of 30 or 40 on Mondays. But I prefer to go alone.”

When asked about this watering hole, Jeong hesitated. “Bunjangsil,” he sighed. “It’s definitely a comforting bar. I try not to go too often but I always somehow find myself there after the third or fourth round. I don’t like going there and meeting people I know all the time. It’s nice to see acquaintances, of course, but sometimes it’s tiring. A lot of actors who are going through hard times frequent this bar. Those people want to see people they know. But me, I’m different. The more I struggle, the more I want to be alone.”

              <p class='logline'>In a crowd of pens, mon ami.</p>
              <p>Mon ami. French for ‘My friend’. In Korea, it’s the name of the everyday pen. More specifically, the Mon Ami 153. Over three billion Mon Amis originally priced at the cost of a newspaper or subway ride have been sold since they first went on sale in 1963. This mighty pen, strewn in living rooms to board rooms, traveled through the decades of hands that transformed postmodern Korea. What would the diligent bronze tip think now after witnessing innumerable close-ups of contracts that brought new infrastructure? How has its hexagonal plastic body endured the panicked grips of students on their race to be the brightest minds? It’s substituted for hair pins. It’s served as a makeshift toy during idle moments. No doubt it’s written the lyrics for many a K-pop star. And though the lining of the pockets in which it’s carried has certainly upgraded, the pen’s design itself has stayed the same.</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>We will never leave our beloved ‘Mon Ami’ but we did go on a quest for the ideal ‘Little Black Pen’ by testing five black ink pens commonly available in Korea.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>But here are some cons. At 200 won a piece, it’s a cheap pen. And it looks it. Though intensely loyal, its ink is not. We will never leave our beloved ‘Mon Ami’ but we did go on a quest for the ideal ‘Little Black Pen’. We tested five black ink pens commonly available in Korea and all priced under 2,500 won. They were judged based on three criteria: appearance, grip and writing experience. All were 0.5 mm and were purchased at a local stationery chain.</p>
              <p>
                <br />
                <strong>1. Dong-A Anygel 501</strong>
                <br />
                Price: 400 won

                Total: 13
              </p>
              <p>For first place we had to choose the Dong-A Anygel 501 because it consistently wrote like a more expensive pen. Inspired, but toned down, from the likes of Waterman or Mont Blanc, the pen gives the user a feeling of authority despite its lightness. Ink quality is deep and consistent. Writing experience is smooth and keeps the pen moving at an agile pace. Best of all, it’s priced at 400 won, just twice the price of our trusty Mon Ami!</p>
              <p>
                <strong>2. Uni-ball Singo</strong>
                <br />
                Price: 1,250
                <br />

              </p>
              <p>The Uni-ball Singo came in at a close second primarily because its ink was not as full-bodied as the Anygel 501. As a writing instrument, the tip mimics a pen from a higher class and its long, extended torso inspires a bit of confidence (perhaps even overconfidence) in one’s hand. The crystal-esque design is not bad to look at, but one actually has to go through the trouble of recapping after use because there’s no retractable ballpoint.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>3. Dong-A U-Knock Gel</strong>
                <br />
                Price: 800 won

              <p>As this pen’s black ink runs down, the clear chamber shows an ugly yellow-orange trail that prematurely foreshadows the pen’s eventual decline to the rubbish bin. The ink is solid but the writing is a bit slippery. The point moves fast and you may find your hand outpacing your thoughts. The length is a bit too short for proper balance and the thin rubberized grip provides no cushion.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>4. Dong-A AnyBall 501</strong>
                <br />

              <p>This pen is not bad to look at. A lot of others are based on the same design, but a bit of a ballooned top here and sharp accents there give this pen a real clean-cut look. Even the ergonomics of the rubberized grip is better than the U-Knock, but this pen falls down hard on the writing experience. The same 0.5mm tip as the others felt even smaller. The amount of ink that comes out feels stingy. In fact, the longer we kept writing with this, the more penny-pinching we felt. We imagine it’s good for clinical, anal-retentive personalities.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>5. Pilot G-2</strong>
                <br />
                Price :2,400 won
                <br />

              <p>This pen is also plagued by the same yellow-orange run-off in the ink chamber as the U-Knock Gel. Without providing any feeling of heft, the thick chassis just makes you feel this pen is overweight and has nothing to show for it. The ink quality is a disaster with numerous white spots in our script. This pen elicits anxiety, like something is going to go wrong at any minute.</p>
              <p>
                <br />
                Our final result is that the best ‘Little Black Pen’ has a bit of white in its design, perhaps in homage to our Mon Ami standby. For its smooth writing, solid balance and ink quality, we kept going back to this pen during our trial period. But more than that, our ‘Little Black Pen’ gave us that ‘feeling’. The one of comfort and warmth of something familiar. And even better, it has workhorse dependability and performance to be there for you when only the best will suffice. And isn’t that what we all want in our friends? Perhaps our new acquaintance and our Mon Ami can become fast friends. Side by side they look compatible, no?

                  The standard array of coffee drinks? Check. Beer and wine? Check. Café fare to appease your appetite? Check. Add in the free Wi-Fi and variety of seating options, and you’ve got a go-to destination in my book. Make a beeline for 405 Kitchen if, for example, you’ve got an hour before dinner and two of your friends need caffeine, another needs a beer, and you, yourself, are starving because one roll of
                  <em>kimbap</em>
                  at 10:30 a.m. does not qualify as lunch. Be forewarned that the main course items are somewhat overpriced, ranging from the mid- to high-teens.
                </p>
                <h2>Space</h2>
                <p>There is one rather unique interior feature that sets 405 Kitchen apart: A semi-lofted area in the back offers floor seating on large, comfy cushions around low, round tables. Kick off your shoes before stepping in, and enjoy the abundant view of the foliage in their veranda., which is especially nice during the day. And should you be out with your honey, floor seating is much more convenient for (discreet) side-by-side snuggling. (But please, lest I regret my words, spare us your more outrageous PDA.)</p>
                <p>
                  Despite my offhand dismissal of “trendy-café-standard,” I personally like the light bulbs that line the chalkboards and the ladles hanging on the wall. The blend of quirky with the well-worn makes for a comfortable

                  (분위기), or atmosphere.

                <h2>Concluding...</h2>
                <p>Next time you’re in Hongdae and need a place to park yourself, try stopping by 405 Kitchen. I think you’ll find that it’s just about right.</p>

              <p>For those of you who are still mourning the passing of Halloween and are already planning next year’s costume, your next opportunity to go incognito may be sooner than you think. As it turns out, Seoul has a thriving community of adults who still love to play dress up, and they won’t be waiting another year to don their apparel. In fact, their next costume party is never more than a few weeks away.</p>
              <p><img alt='Photo by Meagan Mastriani for Seoulist' height='200' src='http://media.seoulistmag.com/images/seoulist_cosplay-dark_300px.jpg' style='border: 0;' width='300' />I’m talking about cosplayers—people who dress up as characters from anime series, movies, cartoons, or video games. Seoul’s growing crowd of cosplayers makes its appearance every month at ComicWorld Korea’s conventions, which also attracts amateur cartoonists, voice actors,
                <em>manhwa</em>
                enthusiasts (만화, or comics), and amused spectators. The two-day events are filled with activities like illustration competitions, trivia quizzes, singing contests, and, of course, a lot of pageantry.
              </p>
              <p>I had chanced upon a few cosplayers in Yangjae Citizen’s Park a few months ago, stragglers seeking refuge from the huge convention at the nearby aT Center. They were hidden among trees but would model for you if you asked. I admired their boldness, as well as the craftsmanship that had gone into their intricate costumes and make-up. I was curious to see what a large group of them would look like all together. On a cool October Sunday, I returned to Yangjae to satisfy that curiosity, and it was a much different scene from the ethereal wisps of fantasy I found in the forest.</p>
              <p>I hadn’t even stepped off the bus when I saw (and heard) the enormous crowd of cosplayers milling around outside the aT Center. Everywhere I looked, there was something different—a rainbow of dayglo wigs and painted skin; giggling gal pals struggling to get coordinated for a group shot; doll-like princesses poised before a ring of DSLR-toting fans; faux fighters brandishing their plastic swords; all manner of creepy and beautiful contact-covered eyes. Perhaps the strangest sight of all was the cosplayers between poses, breaking character to do mundane things like buying sodas and snapping pictures with their smart phones. It was all so overwhelming, surreal, and wildly fun.</p>
              <p><img alt='Photo by Meagan Mastriani for Seoulist' height='450' src='http://media.seoulistmag.com/images/seoulist_cosplay-sailor-moon_300px.jpg' style='border: 0;' width='300' />When I met U.S. Air Force videographer Sarah Brice, she was dressed as Sailor Venus wearing blue colored contacts and a shiny blonde wig. As soon as she saw me raise my camera, she knew what to do, immediately striking a pose. After I snapped a few photos, we started chatting. Before I could even finish asking for her contact information, she had already begun unzipping her knee-high white boots. She pulled out half a piece of folded notepad paper and handed it to me. All it had was her e-mail address, handwritten. It was obvious she had done this before. I complimented her technique, and she said, “Yeah, guess where I keep my cell phone!” as she coyly patted the big blue bow on her chest.

              <p>Sarah is a cosplaying pro who is outgoing, affable, and totally entertaining. She’s anything but the socially awkward fanatic you might imagine meeting at one of these conventions. And she says there are lots of cool, totally normal cosplayers like her out there. On top of a number of conventions back in the States, Sarah has attended about five of the 105 ComicWorld Korea conventions and agreed to share some of her wisdom with Seoulist, in hopes that she can convince others that cosplay isn’t just for freaks and geeks:</p>

                  <strong>SM: Do you think that more people should try cosplaying?</strong>
                </em>
                <br />
                SB: I believe anyone who has ever enjoyed picking a costume for Halloween should try cosplaying. It’s basically a lot similar to the holiday! I bet most people have some sort of Halloween costume, so why not bring it to a convention? I realize that store-bought costumes aren’t usually up to par with the hardcore cosplayers and their fancy costumes, but it’s still a nice start!
              </p>

                  <strong>SM: How did you feel the first time you tried it?</strong>
                </em>
                <br />
                SB: The first time I cosplayed, I went all out. I made a costume from scratch, with the help of a friend. Before then, I had never sewn anything in my life! Imagine the confusion, frustration, and overall sense of accomplishment I felt when I went to Otakon 2010 and won first place in the Amateur division. It was a dream come true! The first time I cosplayed was amazing, and I never looked back! It was always fun to take pictures of the neat costumes, but to be the one that everyone is fawning over? That’s an amazing feeling, too!
              </p>

                <em>
                  <strong>SM: You said you change costumes every month. How do you pick the characters? And where do you get your outfits?</strong>
                </em>
                <br />
                SB: Mostly I want characters that people can recognize—it’s more enjoyable when you see someone flip out because they love the character you represent. Many a time, I have forgotten to bring my costume, or I haven’t finished it in time, so I borrow one of my friends’ costumes. Sometimes I buy my costumes from
                <a href='http://cosplay.com/'>cosplay.com</a>.
                I don’t think I will ever buy one directly from a store, since I like the quality of a hand-made costume much better. I made my Princess Peach costume within a time period of 4 months. I am currently working on Princess Azula from the Avatar TV series.

                  <strong>SM: How would you describe the cosplaying community in Korea?</strong>
                </em>
                <br />
                SB: The Korean cosplaying community is very different than American ones and still similar in some aspects. As cosplayers, we automatically bond easier to each other since we have such an obvious common interest. Koreans are much less touchy-feely and less friendly towards total strangers than Americans, but they still do open up more at conventions than they would otherwise. Something that I have noticed and love about Korean conventions is that people will give you candy sometimes. If you let them take your picture or if you have a costume that they really love. How great is that?
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>
                  <strong>SM: I’ve heard that some hard-line Koreans have a problem with cosplaying, since it’s from Japan. How do you deal with that negative attention?</strong>
                </em>
                <br />
                SB: Our group knows not to be in costume outside of the convention. We get into costume at the convention. There is strength in numbers. I would like to see an anti-Japanese Korean try and angrily tell off a horde of cosplayers.
              </p>
              <p>I sometimes wear my wigs to the convention, and I do get a lot of stares, but usually [people] come up and compliment me. I guess they don’t realize that the bright yellow wigs aren’t my natural hair. Maybe they’re distracted by the large amounts of makeup I wear when cosplaying.</p>
              <p>
                <em>
                  <strong>SM: Do you have any tips for first-timers?</strong>
                </em>
                <br />
                SB: Maybe a warning to cosplayers [in Korea]: They will love your costume, no matter how good or bad it is, so keep that in mind! I try to keep my head from expanding too much when I go to these conventions, since everywhere I go I hear “beautiful” and “great costume” and “I love it so much!” I’m not trying to build up my ego here. It’s just something you end up experiencing at a Korean convention. When I crossplayed (dressed as a male character) at one convention, I was told I was “handsome.” See? They compliment everything!
              </p>
              <p>Also, cosplaying with a group of friends is way more fun than doing it by yourself. Cosplaying as a group for a certain anime or series is even more fun, but be prepared to get bombarded with a crazy amount of people wanting to take a group picture of you. Some people might find it tiring, but you could always just say “no.”</p>
